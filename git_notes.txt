Notes from Vlad's git talk Tech Friday 21 March 2014

Commit message tense

    git diff --staged

    git log

origin is just a name
master is just a name (for the master branch)

These are just conventions.

Create a new branch:

    git checkout -b new_branch

Show status of branches:

    git branch -list

    git checkout master

    git checkout new_branch

(commit all)
    git commit -am "message"

    git merge master
(do you need an add now?)

"git pull" does a "git fetch" (to download and store but not to change it)
Then it does "git merge"

    git feature branch workflow

    git push -u origin.
